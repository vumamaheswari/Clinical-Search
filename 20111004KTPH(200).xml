- MRI Lumbar spine 26/09/11 : L4-L5 posterior central disc protrusion likely abutting both descending L5 nerve roots and mild narrowing of the spinal canal and both lateral recesses. Focal area of high signal on T2W images, appearing low signal on T1W images. This could represent a haemangioma, however, in view of clinical history, a metastatic deposit should also be considered. No cord compression detected as per clinical concern.
- CT Brain 27/09/11 : Involutional and chronic microvascular ischemic changes as noted in the prior MR study. No mass or intracranial haemorrhage or abnormal enhancement detected.
- Patient stable on discharge with no pain complaints. To be followed up by HCA Hospice Care.

-US abdomen (28/9/11): LIVER - Impression:  Presence of multiple mass lesions in the liver on an overall cirrhotic picture is suggestive of a neoplastic aetiology, a triphasic CT scan is suggested for further optimal evaluation. 
-Triphasic CT scan (29/9/11): The portal and hepatic veins remain patent. Mild to moderate ascites seen in the abdomen and pelvis. Incidental uncomplicated large bowel diverticula, non-obstructing left calyceal calculi and mild prostatomegaly.Overall findings are suspicious of multifocal hepatocelluar carcinoma. Background cirrhosis and hepatomegaly associated with multiple regenerative/dysplastic nodules. 

-Referred to GE : Impression -Conveyed that it is multifocal HCC and is not a suitable candidate for surgery or local -regional therapy. Plan to start on lamivudine based on the HBV DNA load and suggested for a screening OGD: to rule out varices. Prognosis is 6months to 1 year as per Gastroenterologist Dr Eric Wee.

S/B NCC Med onco Dr Ooi Wei Seong - explained to patient poor prognosis given Hep B positive multifocal HCC. planned to start Soratenib 200mg BD after OGD by gastro. Planned to TCU NCC Dr Tham Chee Kian

ECG: normal sinus rhythm
CXR: No cardiomegaly, no focal consolidation or effusion
X-ray L foot: no bony abnormality

ISSUES AND PROGRESS

1. L ankle swelling secondary to osteoarthritis
- patient has had history of generalised chronic arthritic pains for &gt;2 years
- f/u with private GP and polyclinic for analgesia - advised that likely due to strain caused by work 
- U/S Doppler L LL - no sonographic evidence of DVT
- Day 2 of admission - swelling settling, no more ankle pain                         
- uric acid normal, Rh factor and anti-CCP negative for RA 
- likely due to osteoarthritis 
- advised to rest ankle, given fastum gel to help with swelling
- pt also referred to MSW to consider changing job - daughter has found new job for her

2. Iron deficiency anaemia
- patient takes good diet, no reflux symptoms or epigastric pain 
- referred to gastro to rule out gastric cause for anaemia in view of chronic NSAID use and ?hx of gastritis
- OGD report: small white plaques at the GE junction ?candida. Biopsy to look for fungus. Antrum non-erosive gastritis (very mild). H.pylori -ve. No cause of anaemia seen. Duodenal mucosa normal. No scalloping seen. 
- In view of normal OGD, referred for colonoscopy
- Colonoscopy: Fair prep in ascending colon with semisolid faeces, unable to clear. Small lesions would be missed if present. Normal up to sigmoid where there was a small poly 4mm ?hyperplastic, benign looking. Hot biopsy taken, Small haemorrhoids. 
- menorrhagia most likely cause of anaemia
- started on ferrous fumarate
- also given B12 replacement in view of borderline low B12 level 
- advised to go back to KKH to complete current investigations and follow-up in view of anaemia
- daughter (nurse) also aware and will ensure that patient does not default

CT brain: R MCA territory infarct with suspicion of tiny internal haemorrhage, no mass effect 
ECG: Sinus tachycardia, no ST changes  

ISSUES AND PROGRESS

1. Stroke - right MCA infarct
- patient recovering well with power 4+/5 on 2nd day of admission, eating normally prior to admission, continued on normal diet with supervised feeding. No aspiration/ choking. 
- Gait fairly steady 
- underwent MR stroke protocol to exclude any haemorrhage
- MRI brain/ stroke protocol: R MCA territory infarct with no evidence of haemorrhagic conversion 
- Referred to PT/OT/ST 
- U/S carotids normal 
- Thrombophilia screen requested - awaiting results
- Noted to have PSM - ECHO requested 

2. Iron deficiency anaemia 
- Hb 9.7 on admission 
- Iron sats 6.69%, TIBC 44.82, Ferritin 565, Iron 3.0
- Referred to gastro re suitable time for scope in view of recent MCA infarct
- S/B Dr Eric Wee: amenable to scope after day 5 of stroke
- OGD: Small hiatus hernia, Small submucosal nodule 5mm only at the cardia. Otherwise no cause of anaemia seen. H.pylori negative. 
- Gastro advice: Tiny submucosal nodule not likely to be of any significance. However, follow-up may be performed in 6 months' time with OGD to look at size
- Pt refused colonoscopy and repeat OGD in 6 months 
- Commenced on ferrous fumarate 200mg bd 

3. Severe mitral regurgitation with pulmonary hypertension 
- ECHO: 
- dilated left heart chambers
- normal LV systolic fn
- aortic valve sclerosis, mild AR
- flail mitral valve, posterior leaflet
- severe MR, mild PR and TR 
- mild pulm HTN 
- thickened mitral leaflet tips consistent with a prior history of rheumatic valve disease
- mild mitral stenosis with severe regurgitation. Giant left atrium 
- referred to neurology re anticoagulation in view of giant left atrium
- patient discharged against medical advice prior to review
- anticoagulation discussed with patient - indications and monitoring - pt not keen for regular blood taking

4. Presumptive endocarditis

1. posterior circulation stroke
- on next day to admission day, patient show left cerebellar sign and extensor plantar response bilaterally and bilateral lower limb weakness compared to both upper limbs
- started on stroke pathway
- MRI MRA stroke protocol was done on 20/09/2011
Acute infarcts in both cerebellar hemispheres and foci of acute infarcts in left pons and left occipital cortex as described.
Background involutional and microvascular ischemic changes. 
Limited MRA assessment due to motion artifacts. Mild narrowing of proximal basilar artery, right proximal PCA (with paucity of its branches) and both cavernous ICAs.

- giddiness and dizziness was treated symptomatically with cinnarizine
- gradually improved and tolerated with PT OT
- swallowing - initially patient was on modified diet due to drowsiness but escalated to soft diet and thin fluid later on 

2. low grade fever
- CRP and Procal were negative though TW 18 and slight fever
- but septic work up done and cultures were negative
- no antibiotics was started, fever settled

3. rehab and discharge plan
- seen by PT OT
- suggested SSR (either as day rehab or CH)
- family opted for CH as the daughter might not be able to care at the moment 

4. risk factor management and secondary prevention 
- continued with clopidogrel as patient had history of GI bleed
- old stroke disease - antiplatelet
- DM - sugar control with sc insulin, stopped metformin as sugar control satisfactory
- hypertension - restarted 
- dyslipidemia - continue with simvastatin 
- old age and being male sex 

5. left arm cellulitis

Issues and progress

1. Acute CVA (right MCA territory)
- continued on aspirin
- 2DE: EF 60%, LVH, normal systolic function. no thrombus
- underwent PT/OT in ward
- PT OT was limited by poor cooperation from cognitive impairment
- But patient was found more cooperative and carer was supportive, and decided for SSR 

2. ARU and UTI
- c/o abdo pain
- a/w frequency (small amounts) and haematuria
- IDC inserted, underwent overnight continous bladder washout
- UFEME RBC &gt;2000, WBC 31, EC 2
- urine c/s NBG
- uro r/v for painless gross haematuria - CT urogram and cystoscopy
- CT urogram - normal
- haematuria resolved
- trial off catheter done on 20/9/11 &gt; failed 
- flexible cystoscopy done on 21/9/11 - no significant mechanical lesion causing retention of urine, to trial off catheter later and NFU Urology

- on 23/9/11, patient spiked temperature up to 38
- empirically started with PO ciprofloxacin 
- sent for urine FEME and culture - growing Proteus spp sensitive to Ciprofloxacin 
- fever lysed and patient was well and active 
- to continue antibiotics for one week and to repeat urine culture 3-4 days after stopping antibiotics
- to continue with IDC at the moment and to trial off catheter in CH

3. AF
- rate - under control
- initially planned to start warfarin but it was held off due to haematuria
- after reassessment of the functional status, GRM medical team decided not for warfarin in view of poor cognitive function, difficult to monitor and high fall risk
- family understands the risk and benefit of warfarin and agreed with the medical team's plan

4. swallowing impairment secondary to CVA and cognitive impairment 
- s/b ST: mild dysphagia, for pureed diet and thin fluids
- initial swallowing impairment was improved and diet was escalated to minced diet and chopped sides

progress
- patient was afebrile for 2-3 days
- no change in mental status
- alert, cheerful
- IDC urine was clear but concentrated 
- no more haematuria

issues
1. back pain secondary to acute T12 vertebra fracture
- on 20/08/11, patient claimed that he had weakness in both lower limbs after the fall
- on repeated neurological examination, there was weakness in left lower limb power  by one point (4/5) with extensor plantar response in left side, a/w saddle anaesthesia
- in view of new neurological deficit, sent for 
MRI thoraco-lumbar spine on 20/08/11
1. Lumbar spondylosis as described above.
2. Acute fracture involving D12 vertebral body &amp; bilateral pedicles. Posterior convex margin indents on the thecal sac anteriorly. No cord compression noted at this level.
3. Chronic complete collapse of L2 vertebra. The posterior margin is causing compression of the thecal sac and it is contents at this level however with no significant nerve root compression.      
4. Multilevel posterior disc osteophyte complexes as described above.

- started analgesia and continued with forsamax 
- referred to orthopaedics 
- explained to the family regarding PT OT with lumbar orthosis vs spine stabilising operation 
- family opted for operation and convinced the patient, seen by anaesthetist &gt; risk 3-5% of having CVA, AMI and other mjor complications
- patient finally refused to proceed with operation and for conservative management
- can mobilise with full weight bearing 

pain control
- patient had severe pain pain score 7-8 / 10 on movement of the spine, especially sitting and other weight bearing
- forsamax has to be withold because patient could not sit up to take medicine
- intranasal calcitonin 200 unit OM to complete 6 weeks and to review in clinic
- continue with arcoxia and topical analgesia
- added with tramadol but taken off due to loss of appetite and nausea 
- but pain control was poor, so added with PO mist morphine before patient was for PT OT and before sitting up in chair 
- supported with lumbar coset 

- tolerance to PT OT improved and he can stand up with support for brief period
- gradual weaning off morphine done 
- patient was able to walk few steps with walking frame before going home

- care giver training done to the elder daughter, competent

2. abnormal liver function 
- noted GGT was high, ALP was normal
- GGT 118 &gt; 186 &gt; 226 &gt; 261 &gt; 251
- mild rise in ALT and AST
- US HBS done, on 5/9/11
Mild coarsening of the liver.
Simple left renal cysts seen as described above
- iron study done on 17/9/11 iron 18, ferratin 1250, t sat 43.34 (to follow up)

3. poor oral intake associated with depression 
- likely due to constipation, opiod analgesia 
- cleared bowel
- GDS done score 5/15 (Geriatric Depression Scale)
- started Matirzapine 7.5 mg ON and increased to 15 mg ON
- mood was still fluctuating
- complicated by dehydration and postural hypotension 
- enalapril was stopped
- iv fluid supplement given 
- matirzapine increased up to 30 mg ON
- mood much improved, cheerful, co operated with therapy

4. tachycardia
- found resting tachycardia of 100- 110/ min
- not associated with postural hypotension 
- hydration status - fair
- after iv hydration trial - no change in heart rate
- no sign of hyperthyroidism TFT normal / hypoadrenalism (cortisol - normal) / postural hypotension / dehydration / anaemia / heart failure / infection (CRP 16)
- tachycardia was assoicated even with high BP upto 150/100 mmHg
- impression was likely compensated diastolic dysfunction 
- requested for 2DEcho, done on 23/09/11, EF 60%, prolonged left ventricular relaxation, no RWMA, aortic valve sclerosis but not stenosis
- empirically started with bisoprolol in suspicion of rebound tachycardia after stopping atenolol 

5. discharge plan
- multiple MDM rounds
- initially planned for community hospital of SSR
- family was not very keen 
- so arranged for CGT and day rehab 
- reminded that if family can't cope at home, to consider CH
- care co ordinator to follow up regarding home situation

2. Liver cirrhosis Child's B likely idiopathic 
- persistent vague abdominal discomfort 
- albumin was replaced 

- US abdomen was done:
Ascites
Bilateral renal cysts.
Non-specific gallbladder wall thickening. This may be due to ascites. However, in view of history of right hypochondral pain, cholecystitis cannot be excluded.

- HBsAg and anti-HBsAb negative 
- anti-HCV negative 
- not alcoholic 
- decision was not further work up, likely idiopathic 

3. NSTEMI with mild CCF

Pt/ INR normal
DIVC screen: fibrinogen 39 &gt; 39 &gt; 32.2 (normal)


septic w/u was done
Noted persistent hypotensive episodes 
requiring multiple fluid boluses

pt was started on iv rocephine and flagyl
given 2 doses of amikacin before cultures were known ( in view of initial result of Gram negative rods)

CT abdomen pelvis

1.            Right liver lobe mass ( 7 x 6.5 x 5.5cm), multiseptated- most likely Liver abscess
2.  Enhancing 12mm  nodule in segment 6 lateral to mass, DD-pseudoaneurysm, flash   haemangioma, .Should be avoided if percutaneous drainage done
3. Large uterus lesion, likely fibroid, measuring  11x 9 x 8 cm, no adnexal masses, no  bleeding
4. Few uncomplicated colonic diverticulae.
5. Bilateral pleural effusion with basal atelectasis, likely reactive


On review of abdomen, noted that tenderness in lower abdomen had increased and rebound tenderness 
was elicited


Ref to GS: 
after review of patient, adv to continue with medical management
adv to s/t interventional radiologist re: drainage of the abscess
adv to ref O&amp; G re: lower abdominal tenderness and fibroid


s/t interventional radiologist:
Prof Teh HS:
high risk procedure, for bleeding in view of
1) hemangionma
2) Coagulopathy
3) thrombocytopenia

As lesion was loculated, only able to drain 1 locule leaving beind rest of abscess
Decision not to proceed with percutaneous drainage


Ref to O&amp;G 

Referral was made when pt had a tender abdomen with rebound tenderness elicited in the lower abdomen
O&amp;G impression was that pt's fibroid was not the cause of her abdominal signs
treatment for a denegenerative fibroid was to manage pain
no indication for urgent O&amp;G review at the time

Ref to Hepatobiliary team

Impression of sepsis from multi loculated klebsiella liver abscesss 9 segment 5,6,7,8 with S6 hemangioma
adv to continue on current treatment as pt was responding
and to re-image abscess in 5-7 days, ( by ultrasound) 
to consider percutaneous drainage then, if the collection was &gt; 5 cm (INR &lt; 1.5 and PLT &gt; 100K)
Surgical resection was a last resort
HPB took over care of patient
Ref to eye made in view of klebsiella pneumoniae in blood, to rule out any eye involvement-no eye involvement noted

-US HBS repeated on 12/9:IMPRESSION:
Heterogeneous mass in the right lobe of the liver, likely a liver abscess. It shows mild increase in size compared to the CT, bearing in mind technical differences. 
Mild thickening of the gallbladder wall may be due to third space fluid loss or low albumin state. 
Left pleural effusion. 
-Percutaneous drainage(VIR) done on 14/9: Gram smear of aspirate showed no organisms.
aspirate culture grew : Klebsiella Pneumoniae 
-IV rocephine was continued given for 2/52
-oralised to Augmentin for 6/52(in v/o downward trend of TW and clinical improvement)
-IV Flagyl given for 10 days.

2) PULMONARY EDEMA
Pt had an episode of desaturation on 5/9/11
CXR showed pulmonary edema
ABG: respi alkalosis with metabolic compensation
clinical exam revealed bilateral bibasal crepitations and raised JVP 
fluids were decreased and repeat ABG showed improvement as did CXR
clinical signs also improved
2DE obtained on 7/9/11 to assess EF: normal
weaned off NRM and ventimask down to 3 litres of O2
-weaned off O2 on 12/9/11  as patient tolerating well.
-TOC done on 12/9 : successful (catheterised for I-O charting.)

3.) UTI : pyuria
-culture  grew no organism 
-increased frequency and incontinence noted (14/9)
-covered by rocephine 
-IMC done  for 4 days
-off the imc after PVRU 81 mls post void.(19/9)
-referred  continence nurse: to f/u
-encouraged prompted voiding.

4.) DVT prohlylaxis: Clexane given for 5 days.

==Relevant Ix==

Hb 14.7 TW 8.66 Plt 261
Cr 77 PT 10.9 INR 1.08 APTT 22.7
XR, R ankle/tib/fib/foot: Fracture of the distal tibial shaft is seen with anterior and lateral displacement of the distal fragment. A comminuted segmental fracture of the distal fibular shaft is also noted.  The knee joint appears normal in alignment.  The tibial talar joint appears grossly normal in alignment on this limited lateral radiograph.
There is suggestion of fractures at the bases of first and second metatarsals.
CXR: No fracture/pneumothorax/consolidation
XR pelvis: No fracture
CT brain: No fracture or intracranial haemorrhage detected.

==Injuries sustained==

1) Right tibia and segmental fibula open fracture (Gustillo 3C)
&gt; 3 lacerations over distal tib/fib antero-medial and anterolateral aspect and dorsum of foot 
2) Right cuneiform open fracture with joint subluxation
3) Right 1st, 2nd, 3rd metatarsal base fractures 
4) Injured right anterior tibial artery
5) Ruptured right anterior tibialis tendon

==Issues and Progress==

1) Right ATA injury 
- S/T Prof.Peter Robless(NUH Vascular)
&gt; CT angiogram, B/L LL: Features of obstruction / injury of the right anterior tibial artery in its distal third with surrounding soft tissue injury [probably due to compression by surrounding soft tissue edema]. However at the level of ankle it appears patent. No obvious active arterial extravasation seen. The posterior tibial and peroneal arteries appear normal throughout their course.
- also noted palpable PT (confirmed with Doppler) intra-op
- updated Prof. Robless re: above
&gt; no need for any vascular intervention as distal flow is good and no evidence of ischaemia

2) Right LL tib/fib open fracture(Gustillo 3C)
- started empirically on cephazolin/gentamicin
- underwent mulitple ops for the above mentioned injury:

12/8/11: Right LL WD, external fixation and ORIF of R cuneiform by Mr. Chen YD
- intra- op findings:
&gt; Gustillo III C open fracture right tibia/ fibula distal shaft, with butterfly fragment at tibia,
&gt; 3 lacerations, one at anterior medial , one anterior lateral, one at dorsum of foot
&gt; anterior tibial artery cut
&gt; tibialis anterior tendon rupture
&gt; open fracture cuneiform with joint subluxation
&gt; post ext fixation, PT well palpable and comfirmed with Doppler
- started on IV cefazolin

14/8/11: Right LL WD, VAC and adjustment of ex-fix by Mr. Yong Ren
- intra-op findings:
&gt; R TIB/FIB OPEN #
&gt; SKIN EDGES MACERATED AND UNDER TENSION/UNHEALTHY

17/8/11: Right LL WD, VAC and adjustment of ex-fix by Mr. Joel Ho
- intra-op findings:
&gt; Gustilo IIIC open right tibial / fibular fracture with large devascularized butterfly fragment at tibia
&gt; Butterfly fragment relatively clean with no FB or gross contamination-&gt; D/W team Con/AC suggest to readjust Ex-Fix and retain butterfly fragment
&gt; skin edges healthy
&gt; right anterior compartment muscles unhealthy
&gt; Tib ant avulsed with frayed ends, tendon healthy
&gt; FHL partially cut
&gt; Resultant anterolateral defect measuring 7 x 3cm with exposed bone ( perosteum stripped) and anteromedial defect measuring 15 x 10 cm
- tissue c/s: NBG

20/8/11: R LL WD, VAC, ajustment of ex-fix, removal of butterfly fragment and Abx cement spacer application by Mr. Chen YD
- intra-op findings:
&gt; rt Tibia - wound grossly clean, minimal unhealthy tissue

23/8/11: R LL Wound debridement, adjustment of external fixator, insertion of bone cement and application VAC dressing by Soumen Das De and Antony Xavier Rex Premchan
- intro op findings: Right leg - DOPPLER: triphasic signal in PTA and sural system. No flow detected in ATA / dorsalis pedis - wounds fairly clean with some degree of non-viable subcutaneous tissue - 100% laceration of EHL and tibialis anterior - tagged to skin for future identification and repair - distal foot wound unhealthy at proximal tip of skin flap - bone edges healthy with no visible slough or pus - segment of cortical bone that was removed at previous surgery was preserved in sterile condition --&gt;decision made to discard this as it would not be of further use

29/8/11: Right LL open reduction internal fixation of right open tibia fracture, wound debridement and sural island flap coverage by Chen Yingdong and Rajaratnam Vaikunthan- intro op findings: right tibia fracture comminuted with bone loss over anterior tibia cement with anitibiotics in siu wound over medial aspect healthy, no slough wound over ant-lateral aspect healthy, no slough wound over anterior foot skin edges slightly unhealthy, slight slough DP and PT present with doppler

14/9/2011: Right leg wound debridement, skin flap coverage of exposed plate
-intra-op findings: 2x foot dorsum wound clean, granulating well Exposed plate medial aspect of tibia Minimal necrotic tissue around flap debrided, rest of flap viable, healthy

20/9/2011: Right leg wound debridement , split thickness skin graft of lower limb wounds  
- intra-op findings: Two x dorsal foot wounds clean and granulating Anterolateral wound adjacent to sural flap clean and granulating Previous rotational skin flap coverage - ischemic edges with minimal necrotic tissue - debrided clean Right lateral malleolar K-wire wound necrotic edges Dorsal foot K-wires tract sites clean Thin film of greenish slime over previous SSG site over posterior calf- Decision made to use silver dressing ( Urgotul Silver) Previous surgical wounds healed - STO done

3) Ruptured right anterior tibialis tendon
- clinically loss of EHL function, loss of R toe extension

08/09/2011 debridement of right leg wounds, weaving of EHL to EDL and VAC dressing
- Intraop findings: necrosis of sural flap wound, at proximal medial and distal medial corners die back about 1cm , tibia and implant exposed no frank pus , hematoma deep to flap distal flap wound : SSG failed to take foot dorsum wound clean tibialis anterior proximal retracted, irretrievable EHL tendon distal stump seen in foot wound, EDL to all 4 other toes in continuity calf SSG site clean, taken well, donor site on posterior thigh clean 
- tissue c/s pseudomonas sensitive to ceftazidime.
- patient was started on IV ceftazidime on 11/9/2011

US HBS of 27-SEP-2011:

FINDINGS: 

Liver:   
-Size:     enlarged . Spam 15.2 cm.
-Echogenicity:     Coarse, increased and heterogeneous .
-Contour:      Irregular
-Mass:  

7 cm x 5.2 m x 6.3 cm solid mass lesion is seen in the segment 6 of the right lobe of liver close to the right kidney. It has heterogeneous texture and some blood vessels are present on Doppler ultrasound examination.
    


Portal vein     Large partial thrombus is seen in the main portal vein in the porta-hepatis extending into the left branch and minimally into the right branch of the portal vein. There is hepato-fugal flow seen in the 
Remaining lumen of the portal vein.

The hepatic artery is patent however it has high PSV upto 173 cm/s.

Bile ducts:
-Intrahepatic bile ducts:   Not dilated
-Extrahepatic bile ducts:   Not dilated 
-Common bile duct measures:  5 mm

Gallbladder:    Normal
      No cholelithiasis
                 No sonographic tenderness   
The GB wall is thickened . 4 mm.     

Pancreas:     Normal  

Spleen:     Enlarged   13.8 cm .

Kidneys: 
-Right kidney:     Normal. Measures    9.5 cm in length
-Left kidney:       Normal. Measures  10.6 cm in length

Visualized Aorta &amp; Inferior vena cava: normal
    
Ascites:         None

IMPRESSION:   

Cirrhosis of liver with portal vein thrombosis.
There is a 7 cm x 5.2 m x 6.3 cm solid mass in the segment 6 of the right lobe of liver suggestive of HCC.


CT MULTI-PHASIC LIVER of 28-SEP-2011:

HISTORY :? HCC

REPORT
The ultrasound of Sept 27, 2011 was reviewed.

Thrombosis of the portal vein is again noted in keeping the findings on ultrasound of Sept 27, 2011.  Thrombus is seen extending into the (L) and (R) intrahepatic divisions, and the superior mesenteric and proximal splenic veins.

Liver:
- An exophytic mass is noted extending from  the inferior margin of segment 6, measuring 5.6 x 6.7 x 5.3 cm, (Se 506/39 and 503/61).  Pooling of contrast with preferential arterial enhancement and delayed washout is noted in its superior aspect, (Se 22/56).  The mass appears to displace the right kidney posreromedially , and extends beyond  the lower pole, indenting  the (R) lower renal pole, obliterating the separating fat plane at this point. However, there is no demonstrable frank renal invasion. 

- Heterogeneity of the liver parenchyma is probably attributed to portal vein thrombosis.
- Nodular outline in keeping with underlying cirrhosis.
- No biliary dilatation.

A few celiac nodes are noted, (Se 505/41), with perinodal stranding. Although unenlarged, by size criteria, these are deemed significant.  

There is ascites and mesenteric stranding is likely reactive in nature.
No demonstrable peritoneal enhancement or nodularity.

Splenomegaly is observed.
Normal gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys.
The bowel loops are normal in configuration and demonstrate normal wall enhancement.
Dependent changes are noted in the included lung bases.
Save for degenerative changes, no overt bony lesion is seen.

CONCLUSION

1. Heterogeneous , exophytic mass arising from the inferior aspect of the (R) hepatic lobe with portal vein thrombosis, celiac adenopathy and background liver cirrhosis is suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma.  

2. The mass abuts and indents the (R) lower renal pole,  with obliteration of the separating fat plane.  However there is no demonstrable renal invasion.  

3. The corticomedullary differentiation is preserved.
4. Heterogeneity of the liver parenchyma may be attributed to portal vein thrombosis.

Impression:
1) HCC secondary to Hep B cirrhosis complicated by portal vein thrombosis
-CHild-Pugh B
-Bilateral, not amenable to surgical resection/TACE/Sorafenib

******Issues******

CXR: Whiteout appearance of the L hemithorax with displacement of the mediastinum to the right, in keeping with a large left pleural effusion. In addition, there are scattered lytic lysions diffusely involving the bony structures, namely in the clavicles, humeral heads and ribs. If there is a known primary malignancy, metastases should be considered and bone scan correlation may be helpful. Differential diagnosis includes multiple myeloma. 
ECG: Sinus tachycardia 



CT THORAX, ABDOMEN &amp; PELVIS (Contrast enhanced axial scan) of 23-SEP-2011:
FINDINGS: THORAX
There is a left chest tube insitu the tip of which is located in the posterior aspect of mid left hemithorax. Surgical emphysema in left chest wall adjacent to the chest tube. 
Lungs: Small ill-defined nodules and relatively larger irregular nodules are present in the left upper and mid zones respectively. These are likely consolidation rather than lung nodules / metastases.  
Larger consolidation is seen in the left lower lobe lung base. 
Airway:      Normal
Pleura: Small left pleural effusion and pneumothorax. Tiny pleural based nodules in upper left lung, the largest measures 5mm.
Thoracic aorta and great vessels:   Normal
Pulmonary arteries:    Normal
Heart and pericardium:    Normal
Lymph nodes:     
Mediastinal:    Not enlarged
Hilar:     Not enlarged
Axillary: Several nodes in the axillae slightly larger on the left. The largest is 1.1 x 1.0cm on the left.
Chest wall: Left breast is totally fatty replaced. Patchy ill-defined hyperdense soft tissue noted in the right breast with associated overlying skin thickening. Underlying malignancy cannot be totally excluded. 
Thyroid:     Normal
ABDOMEN AND PELVIS
Liver:      Normal
Gallbladder : Contracted containing 1.7 x 1.7 cm calculus and tiny calcified calculi. No adjacent inflammatory stranding.
Biliary tree:     Normal
Spleen:      Normal
Pancreas:      Normal
Kidneys:      Normal, 5mm hypodense lesion in the left lower pole is likely a cortical cyst.
Adrenal glands:   Normal on the right, left contains 1.0 cm nodule
Stomach:      Normal
Small bowel:     Normal
Large bowel:     Normal
Pelvis:      Normal
Mesentery/Peritoneum:    Normal 
Free fluid:     No
Blood vessels:     Normal, no aneurysm
Lymphadenopathy:      No 

Skeletal structures : Mixed lytic and sclerotic changes are seen involving all the visualized bones. Bony alignment and heights of the vertebral bodies are preserved.

IMPRESSION:
" Mixed lytic and sclerotic changes involving all the visualized bones are suspicious for metastases.
" Primary lesion may likely from right breast.
" Several consolidation in left lung.
" Small left hydropneumothorax.
" Gall stones.



US BREASTS (BOTH SIDES) 23-SEP-2011 04:15 PM
Ultrasound scan of the right breast was performed.  There was a palpable lump which corresponded to the irregular  ill-defined, micro lobulated mass measuring 
40 x 28 x 25 cm in size, seated at the 12 o'clock position about 10 mm from the nipple. The lesion is focaly involving the overlying skin. The mass is not parallel to the skin by orientation, it shows strong posterior acoustic shadowing.
There are at least two of similar but smaller foci in the upper lateral quadrant at the 
10 o'clock position, the larger measures 15 mm in size.  There is also a small similar lesion at the 1 o'clock position, close to the main lesion.
No lymph nodes noted in the right axilla
Impression:
The finding is suggestive of multifocal malignancy. BI-RADS 5




NM BONE SCAN 27-SEP-2011 06:04 PM
Report:
Tc99m HDP whole body bone scan and planar imaging of the skull, thorax, pelvis, knees and ankles were performed with 17.3 mCi dose of Tc99m HDP.
Scans show multiple sites of mild to moderately intense tracer uptake (some are in a discrete pattern, and some are in a diffuse pattern) at the following sites:  
1) multiple sites of the skull vault and the skull base.
2) left side of the mandible.
3) several ribs, bilaterally.
4) both humerii (including the heads and shafts), both forearms (radius and ulna).
5) upper border of the sternal manubrium, left clavicle and left coracoid process.
6) T4, T5, T11 and T12 vertebrae.
7)  multiple sites of the sacrum, both sacroiliac joints, and the ischii.
8) left femur (including the trochanteric region, shaft and condylar areas)
9) entire right lower limb (from femur to foot) with most intense uptake at the knee (most intense at lateral condyle) and ankle/foot (most intense at calcanum and medial malleolus).

Comment:
1) Extensive bone metastases at the above mentioned sites, 1-9.
2) Please note that part of the findings demonstrated at the right lower limb are likely due to combination of post traumatic degenerative osteoarthritis (affecting the knee, ankle and foot) and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. 




HISTOLOGY
SPECIMEN TYPE NN11-71508- 27/09/2011  BRENDAN PANG (DR)
A: LEFT PLEURAL FLUID
GROSS DESCRIPTION
Received 120 cc of yellowish fluid (2 Pap and 2 HC)

Clinical notes: Subacute intestinal obstruction for evaluation 

COMPARISON: No comparison study available 

TECHNIQUE: Contrast enhanced axial CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. 80ml of Omnipaque350mgI/ml given at the rate of 2.5ml/s.Oral and rectal contrast given. 

FINDINGS: 

Liver: diffuse low attenuation- possibly fatty infiltration. No focal lesion seen. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. 

Gallbladder: distended, small gall stones seen. No CT evidence of acute cholecystitis. 
Pancreas: No mass seen 
Spleen: Normal 
Kidneys: Normal 
Adrenals: Normal 

Stomach: unremarkable, small hiatus hernia. NG tube in situ, tip abutting the antral wall 
Small bowel: not dilated 
Large bowel: mild gaseous distention with fecal loading in right colon, no definite wall thickening or mass lesion seen. 

Abdominal adenopathy: No 
Ascites: No 
Mesentery / Peritoneum: Normal 
Blood vessels: atherosclerotic changes, mild saccular ectasia of infrarenal aorta ( 2.5cm) 


Pelvic adenopathy No 
Pelvic organs Normal 

Bony lesions severe compression fracture in T12 vertebra, mild compression fracture L1 vertebra. Mild anterolisthesis of L4 over L5 vertebra seen. 
Lung bases atelectatic changes in left lung base 


IMPRESSION: 
1/ No definite evidence of intestinal obstruction 
2/ Small gallstones, no evidence of acute cholecystitis 
3/ Fatty liver 

CT THORAX (ROUTINE) of 22-SEP-2011: 

History: widened mediastinum with cardiomegaly on radiograph 
CECT with 70ml of Omnipaque350mgI/ml given at the rate 1.8ml/s 

Findings: 

Few small hypo dense nodules are noted in the thyroid gland. 

Focal areas of calcification noted in the right infrahilar region. No soft tissue mass is identified in the region. These could be due to calcified hilar nodes. 

Mediastinum: 

There is mild cardiomegaly. 
There is mild dilatation of the ascending aorta to the level of the aortic arch. The maximum diameter measures 3.9 cm. No intimal flap or contrast extravasation identified. 

Mural wall thickening with atherosclerotic changes are noted involving the region of the aortic arch. 
Partially imaged abdominal aorta shows areas of wall calcification with focal ectasia and mild aneurysmal dilatation involving the infrarenal segment. 

Lung fields: 

Sub segmental areas of collapse are noted involving both UL and bilateral LL (more on left side). No mass or consolidation. 

Visualized upper abdomen: 

Non complicated gall stones are noted 

Vertebral column: 

Diffuse degenerative changes noted with severe wedge compression collapse involving T12 and L1 vertebrae. No associated soft tissue noted. 

Approx 80% reduction in vertebral height noted involving T12 anteriorly and in mid portion. 
Approx 30% reduction in vertebral height is noted involving L1 (anteriorly and in mid portion) with vacuum degeneration changes in the vertebral body. Mild retropulsion of the bone fragments at this level cause mild thecal sac indentation. 


Impression: 
1. Mildly aneursymal ascending aorta to the level of aortic arch (maximum diameter 3.9 cms) 
2. Degenerative changes involving dorso-lumbar spine with severe wedge compression collapse involving T12 and L1 vertebrae

-?complicated by bleeding
-pt claimed was transfused with 1 pint blood in delivery room (?primary post partum haemorrhage)
-resumed menses 40/7 post child birth, breast fed for 1/12. stopped breast feeding due to inadequate brest millk production.
-menses was normal, regular
-resumed to usual 6-7 days flow, 28 days cycle
-experienced 'abnormal menses' this month
-LMP 3/9/11. claimed that this cycle is one week earlier than usual regular cycle of 28 days, but normal.Had flow of of 5-6 days. She then had another episode of menses which she claimed to be abnormal 4-5 days after the last day of the previous menses. This episode of 'abnormal menses' lasts til 19/9/11 (2days before admission). During this episode, she had flooding x2 (leak and stained clothings even though using extra long pad). A/w abdominal pain (not started on the first few days of menses). Abdominal pain in the suprapubic region (which she presented with) persisted even after menses stopped x2/7 ago.

-CTAP was done. results as follows:

CT ABDOMEN &amp; PELVIS of 23-SEP-2011:

Clinical history: Past h/o appendiciectomy and adhesiolysis. Now complains of suprapubic pain.

TECHNIQUE: Contrast enhanced axial CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.
No previous CT abdomen &amp; pelvis is available for comparison at the time of reporting.

FINDINGS:

Stomach and Small bowel:  Unremarkable.
Large bowel:    Few small diverticula in splenic flexure region. No focal pericolic fat plane stranding or collection.
 
Liver:     Normal  
Gallbladder:    Few tiny hyperdensities seen layering in the lumen of gallbladder. No pericholecystic stranding or collection. CBD not dilated.
Pancreas:    Normal  
Spleen:    Normal   
Kidneys:    Normal  
Adrenals:     Normal   
Lymphadenopathy:   No significantly enlarged lymph node.
Ascites:      No  
Uterus and ovaries:  No gross uterine or adnexal mass detected. Persistent filling defect noted within the right ovarian vein, which appears dilated. Findings compatible with a right ovarian vein thrombus.
Destructive bony lesion:      No  
Lung bases:    Mild dependent atelectasis seen bilaterally.     

IMPRESSION:

- Right ovarian vein thrombus. 
- Few small gallstones within gallbladder lumen. No CT evidence of acute cholecystitis.
- Few small uncomplicated diverticula of large bowel.


-D/w radiologist reporting CT scan
-extensive R ovarian thrombosis involving entire length of vein
-ovaries not enlarged, no adnexal masses
-no signs of ovarian torsion
-no features suggestive of malignancy/local compression
-suggest pelvic US for more specific imaging of pelvis


-S/T Gynae on call, Dr Lee on 23/9/11
-suggest to refer to haematologist for kiv anticoagulation therapy


-Blue letter referral to Haematologist, Dr Fong
-reviewed pt in the ward
-impression: CT evidence of R ovarian vein thrombosis
 -associated conditions includes:
 1. pelvic inflammatory ds/infection
 2. malignancy/local anatomic lesion (?adhesion)
 3. Hypercoagulability is possible although uncommon

-suggested:
 1.gynae consult to exclude local causes (PID/lesion/anatomic lesion)
 2. Work up of hypercoagulability (bloods sent, results pending)
 3. exclude bleeding given hx of ?previous haematuria.
    if excluded any bleeding and no other contraindication, suggest s/c clexane 1mg/kg 12 hourly given current thrombosis and potential to extend
 4. repeat radioimaging in 1-2/52 kiv (US pelvis + Doppler)
 5. alternative form of contraception (hormone based contraception can increase risk of thrombosis)



-consulted Gynae on call, Dr Steve Teo on  24/9/11 regarding the above
-suggested TCU outpatient TCU KKWCH on coming Monday for US pelvis + Doppler
-May not need to start on anticoagulation. To await evaluation after US 



-Updated Haematologist
-for Gynae management
-Referral from Gynae to Haematology if input from Haematology is needed regarding initiation of anticoagulation therapy.
-For Gynaecology to review reagrding cause of suprapubic pain which is non specific given the history, signs and symptoms

- seen by Gastro on 20/9/11: 
-&gt; likely distal CBD/ampullary obstruction (distal stone vs ampullary lesion), also duodenal diverticulum and duodenal 

nodule 
-&gt; suggest MRCP KIV ERCP +stenting/ampullary biopsy
-&gt; await GS plans for KIV ERCP after discussion with family

2. Drop in Hb
- ? cause
- known anemia, baseline 9-10, previously declined further investigations
- s/p one pint PCT

pt was transferred to GW on 20/9/11
